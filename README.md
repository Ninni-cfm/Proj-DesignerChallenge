# Proj-DesignerChallenge

**Task:**

**How do I become a better designer?**

Early 2018:

I started thinking about how I could improve my design skills and attract more clients. I wanted to design some ideas that I had for a long time only on paper. I decided to look for a challenge that was compatible with my thoughts. I saw that many designers (especially in Dribbble) have created a daily user interface. I liked the idea very much, but the problem was that the result was just something nice, but didn't solve any problem.

So I came up with the idea of this daily challenge.

With this website I want to share my work with you.
